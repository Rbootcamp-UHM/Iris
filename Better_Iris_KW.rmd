#Iris data set is built in, so jumping right into renaming your iris variables
petalL <- iris$Petal.Length
species <- iris$Species

#to group our variable, petal length, into the three major categories presented as species 
unique(species)
pl.setosa <- petalL[species=="setosa"]
pl.virginica <- petalL[species=="virginica"]
pl.versicolor <- petalL[species=="versicolor"]

boxplot(pl.setosa, pl.virginica, pl.versicolor, col=c("red", "green", "blue"), xlab="Species", ylab="Petal Length")		
#this creates a boxplot out of the three grouped variables we named above. We can now see in box plot form how the species compare/contrast in petal length. We have also given each one a seperate color, and named the two axes. 

legend("bottomright", inset=.02, title="Species", c("Setosa", "Virginica", "Versicolor"), fill=c("red", "green", "blue"), horiz=TRUE)
#Because the x axis is only species, it is important to note the different between them. This creates a legend titled Speceis, names the species, and pairs them with the color of their box. It also tells R where to place the legend, in the bottom right.
