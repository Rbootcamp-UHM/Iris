This is a text paragraph in an R Markdown document.

Below is working R code in a code chunk: 

```{r}
fit = lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
b   = coef(fit)
plot(cars)
abline(fit)
```

There are two parameters in a regression: b[1] = `r b[1]` and b[2] = `r b[2]`. Which one is the slope and which is the intercept?
